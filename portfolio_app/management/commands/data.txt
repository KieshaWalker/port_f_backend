1|kiesha walker|Hi, I’m Kiesha Walker — a Full‑Stack Software Engineer who thrives at the intersection of technology, psychology, and operations. With 5+ years of experience, I specialize in building scalable, human‑centric systems that don’t just work — they adapt to real user behavior.


Systems Thinker: From designing probabilistic trading algorithms during COVID to automating booking platforms for Walker K LLC, I’ve consistently turned complexity into clarity — and efficiency into measurable results.

Operational Leader: At French Truck Coffee, I led 60+ employees across four locations, streamlining workflows and scaling operations with the same rigor I now bring to code.

 A graduate of General Assembly’s immersive Software Engineering program (480+ hours), I’ve built full‑stack applications with React, Node.js, Python, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines, always optimizing for maintainability and seamless deployment.

What sets me apart is my ability to bridge disciplines:

A background in psychology and Spanish fuels my human‑centered design and multilingual collaboration (fluent in ASL and Spanish).

My leadership experience ensures I can scale not just systems, but teams.

My curiosity drives rapid self‑learning, whether it’s mastering a new framework or architecting a workflow from scratch.|images/profiles/Screenshot_2025-10-31_at_1.09.11PM.png|llcwalkerk@gmail.com
